         <h2> <i>Stop Consumerism</i></h2>
         <h3>Photoshop, 2017</h3>
         <p>The propoganda poster was one I created to convey, what I believe to be, an ongoing issue within our culture. Lowering my footprint and being conscience of what pocessions I bring into my life is value I hold dear. This design portrays my artistic attraction to minimalism and Mondrian through my simple illustration and use of the primary colors.    </p>

        <h2><i>Festival Poster</i></h2>
        <h3>gouache paint &amp; newspaper collage on bristol vellum, 24x18in, 2017  </h3>
        <p>The documentry film genre can be a difficult one to represent. Since documentaries have the potential to analyze any subject, how do you design a poster to encapsulate the entire category? For me, the solution was illustrating elements every documentry has in common. The main component, being the camera man, is one every single film has in common. Next, the newspaper collage as the background, all documentaries are created for the spread of information, just like news outlets. Lastly, the use of blue as the camera man's shirt was a very purposeful choice; blue is a universal color, meaning no matter where on earth you live, you almost always have the opportunity to see blue, since it is the color of the sky.  </p>

        <h3>charcoal, 24x18in, 2015</h3>
        <p>This portrait of Robert Downey Jr. is a piece of dedication. It's no easy feat making a drawing of this size and detail using charcoal, especially when the medium was brand new to me. </p>

  <h3 class="mediumphoto">digital photography, 2018</h3>
  <p>This collection of photographs documents my parents as they approach 30 years of being married, the pearl year. I found inspiration in my parents for their ongoing dedication and sacrifice not only towards eachother, but to their entire family. I chose to photograph them in a comfortable state, their home. To highlight my mother's beauty and bravery of being one hundren percent natural, I photographed them up close and sharply.  </p>

  <h2><i>SupercaliWorld</i></h2>
  <h3>digital video, 2018</h3>
  <p>Using remixed music, quick cuts, and bright colors, I created an immersive video experience into the childish world of Mary Poppins. My interpretation experiments with the audible excitement throughout the "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" song and portrays that with the video montage.</p>

  <h3>html &amp; css, 2018</h3>

  <p>The Kale Gallery website was created for this fictional company for my edification of coding html and css while learning how to design websites. I started my building process as I always do, by sketching. I then moved on to wireframing and making a sitemap using Axure. Once I was confident and set on my plans, I began coding on Brackets. The end result is a simple, colorful, easy to navigate portfolio for Kale Gallery.</p>
