         <h2> <i>Stop Consumerism</i></h2>
         <h3>Photoshop, 2017</h3>
         <p>The propoganda poster was one I created to convey, what I believe to be, an ongoing issue within our culture. Lowering my footprint and being conscience of what pocessions I bring into my life is a value I hold dear. This design portrays my artistic attraction to minimalism and Mondrian through my simple illustration and use of the primary colors. This piece was featured in my last school's art gallery during the annual student artshow.</p>

        <h2> <i>Juke</i></h2>
        <h3>Adobe Illustrator, 2017</h3>
          <p>Juke is my twin brother's dog. I decided to participate in this popular trend of digital work to make a piece I knew my twin would enjoy. I began this project without much ambition, but it soon blossomed into a long term process because of the amount of detail I decided to include. This piece is made entirely of triangles, ranging in size from almost unnoticable within the collar, to larger face components, to the long, obtuse, triangles of the whiskers.</p>

        <h2> <i>Zoomed Pineapple</i></h2>
        <h3>colored ink &amp; colored pencils on hot pressed paper, 30x22in, 2016</h3>
           <p>This large fruit drawing was made to represent the intricacy and variances in depth on the surface of a pineapple and its layered leaves. I used colored ink to create the broad, general, and darker areas of the drawing. I later layered over the ink with colored pencils to add the smaller details and texture. This piece was featured in my last school's art gallery during the annual student artshow. </a></p>

        <h2><i>Festival Poster</i></h2>
        <h3>gouache paint &amp; newspaper collage on bristol vellum, 24x18in, 2017  </h3>
        <p>The documentry film genre can be a difficult one to represent. Since documentaries have the potential to analyze any subject, how do you design a poster to encapsulate the entire category? For me, the solution was illustrating elements every documentry has in common. The main component, being the camera man, is one every single film has in common. Next, the newspaper collage as the background, all documentaries are created for the spread of information, just like news outlets. Lastly, the use of blue as the camera man's shirt was a very purposeful choice; blue is a universal color, meaning no matter where on earth you live, you almost always have the opportunity to see blue, since it is the color of the sky.  </p>

        <p>This portrait of Robert Downey Jr. is a piece of dedication. It's no easy feat making a drawing of this size and detail using charcoal, especially when the medium was brand new to me. This piece was featured in my last school's art gallery during the annual student artshow. </p>

        <h2><i>Botanical Illustration: Fuchsia</i></h2>
        <h3>india ink, 30x22in, 2015</h3>
        <p>I took inspiration for this piece from drawings created for educational purposes within the study of plants. Using an ink wash technique, I strove to illustrate this flower and its elements with as much realistic detail as possible. Within the piece, I display the main flower, its individual petals, closed buds, a leaf and branch.</p>

        <p>One way I experiment with typography, composition, and emotions through design, is by creating handmade cards. Card design has been a hobby of mine for close to a decade, only getting better with every celebration that passes.</p>

  <h3 class="mediumphoto">digital photography, 2018</h3>
  <p>This collection of photographs documents my parents as they approach 30 years of being married, the pearl year. I found inspiration in my parents for their ongoing dedication and sacrifice not only towards eachother, but to their entire family. I chose to photograph them in a comfortable state, their home. To highlight my mother's beauty and bravery of being one hundren percent natural, I photographed them up close and sharply.  </p>

  <h2><i>SupercaliWorld</i></h2>
  <h3>digital video, 2018</h3>
  <p>Using remixed music, quick cuts, and bright colors, I created an immersive video experience into the childish world of Mary Poppins. My interpretation experiments with the audible excitement throughout the "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" song and portrays that with the video montage.</p>

  <h3>html &amp; css, 2018</h3>

  <p>The Kale Gallery website was created for this fictional company for my edification of coding html and css while learning how to design websites. I started my building process as I always do, by sketching. I then moved on to wireframing and making a sitemap using Axure. Once I was confident and set on my plans, I began coding on Brackets. The end result is a simple, colorful, easy to navigate portfolio for Kale Gallery.</p>
