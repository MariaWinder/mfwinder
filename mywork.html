      <h2> <i>Zoomed Pineapple</i></h2>
      <h3>colored ink &amp; colored pencils on hot pressed paper, 30x22in, 2016</h3>
         <p>This large fruit drawing was made to represent the intricacy and variances in depth on the surface of a pineapple and its layered leaves. I used colored ink to create the broad, general, and darker areas of the drawing. I later layered over the ink with colored pencils to add the smaller details and texture. This piece was featured in my last school's art gallery during the annual student art show. </a></p>

      <h2><i> RDJ Portrait</i></h2>
      <h3>charcoal, 24x18in, 2015</h3>
      <p>This portrait of Robert Downey Jr. is a piece of dedication. It's no easy feat making a drawing of this size and detail using charcoal, especially when the medium was brand new to me. This piece was featured in my last school's art gallery during the annual student art show. </p>

      <h2><i>Botanical Illustration: Fuchsia</i></h2>
      <h3>india ink on cold pressed paper, 30x22in, 2015</h3>
      <p>I took inspiration for this piece from drawings created for educational purposes within the study of plants. Using an ink wash technique, I strove to illustrate this flower and its elements with as much realistic detail as possible. Within the piece, I display the main flower, its individual petals, closed buds, a leaf and branch.</p>
