         <h2> <i>Stop Consumerism</i></h2>
         <h3>Photoshop, 2017</h3>
         <p>The propaganda poster was one I created to convey, what I believe to be, an ongoing issue within our culture. Lowering my footprint and being conscious of what possessions I bring into my life is a value I hold dear. This design portrays my artistic attraction to minimalism and Mondrian through my simple illustration and use of the primary colors. This piece was featured in my last school's art gallery during the annual student art show.</p>

        <h2><i>Festival Poster</i></h2>
        <h3>gouache paint &amp; newspaper collage on bristol vellum, 24x18in, 2017  </h3>
        <p>The documentary film genre can be a difficult one to represent. Since documentaries have the potential to analyze any subject, how do you design a poster to encapsulate the entire category? For me, the solution was illustrating elements every documentary has in common. The main component, being the camera man, is one every single film has in common. Next, the newspaper collage as the background, all documentaries are created for the spread of information, just like news outlets. Lastly, the use of blue as the camera man's shirt was a very purposeful choice; blue is a universal color, meaning no matter where on earth you live, you almost always have the opportunity to see blue, since it is the color of the sky.  </p>

      <h3>html &amp; css, 2018</h3>

      <p>The Kale Gallery website was created for this fictional company for my edification of coding html and css while learning how to design websites. I started my building process as I always do, by sketching. I then moved on to wireframing and making a sitemap using Axure. Once I was confident and set on my plans, I began coding on Brackets. The end result is a simple, colorful, easy to navigate portfolio for Kale Gallery.</p>
